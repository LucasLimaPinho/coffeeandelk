####  Dependencies

1. Gradle Project
2. Oracle JDK-11.0.8
3. Spring Boot 2.3.4


#### Why Java Spring Boot?

1. Easy dependency injection;
2. Automation of configuration with annotations;
3. Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) manages dependencies;
4. We can use @Annotations right before the method to be called (@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping) etc.
5. Spring Boot DevTools monitors src/main/java, src/main/resources and src/main/tests to automatically restart applications;


#### Why Gradle?

1. Gradle is a dependency & libraries manager; Compiles computer source code into binary code;
2. Create .jar packages to deploy in production - compile, configure metadata and build package;
3. Plug-ins are added in build.gradle; In our case we have plug-ins for java, spring and eclipse (IDE used to develop);
4. Automatized atualization when importing new dependencies;
