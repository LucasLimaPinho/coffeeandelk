####  Dependencies

1. Gradle Project
2. Oracle JDK-11.0.8
3. Spring Boot 2.3.4
4. Elasticsearch 7.6.2
5. Kibana 7.6.2
6. Eclipse IDE
7. Postman


#### Why Java Spring Boot?

1. Easy dependency injection;
2. Automation of configuration with annotations;
3. Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) manages dependencies;
4. We can use @Annotations right before the method to be called (@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping) etc.
5. Spring Boot DevTools monitors src/main/java, src/main/resources and src/main/tests to automatically restart applications;
6. Spring use logback framework - src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml; Appender - where to output logs, Logger: what to log; We can send our logs to files (FileAppender) and console (ConsoleAppender);
7. There are 5 levels of logs: log.trace(), log.debug(), log.info(), log.warn() & log.error()

      **Not sent to appender**: log.trace(), log.debug() & longo & info
      
      **Sent to appender**: log.warn() & log.error()
      
8. Spring Boot already has **Jackson** to serialize/marshall Plain Old Java Objects (POJO) to JSON; POJO are objects from classes that has no business logic - only method for setters, getters, toString, equals, hashCode; Gradle already handles Jackson dependency; For converting POJO into JSON, Jackson will call GETTERS; For converting JSON to POJO, Jackson will call SETTERS;
9. To convert JSON to POJO, the class must be public; The class must have no-arguments constructor that are automatically created by Java with ALT+SHIFT+S; You can't define any other constructor for the serialization with Jackson to work;
10. **O POJO sempre deve ter um no-argument constructor para que possa ser realizado o unmarshalling no mÃ©todo HTTP POST**
11. @JsonInclude may stablish someconditions for the field to be exposed in the response API; **Show attribute conditionally**. Example: show attribute only if is not empty or not null.      
12. @JsonIgnore hide attribute in JSON, non conditionally;
13. @JsonIgnoreProperties is another way of ignoring properties; You can type name of attributes you want to ignore on marshalling; This is a class level annotation, so it should be written before the class.
14. @JsonUnwrapped: generate child objects attributes as its parents. @JsonUnwrapped makes attributes from nested fields become attriutes of the parent class; It is simples with example with "engine" and "car"; Engine attributes will no longer be under the umbrella of engine object and it will be shown regularly in the response API; After @JsonUnwrapped, "fuelType" and "horsePower" is part of car object in JSON;
15. In application.yml, you can set jackson.property-naming-strategy to SNAKE_CASE and all the fields in the response will be in snake_case format;

#### Why Gradle?

1. Gradle is a dependency & libraries manager; Compiles computer source code into binary code;
2. Create .jar packages to deploy in production - compile, configure metadata and build package;
3. Plug-ins are added in build.gradle; In our case we have plug-ins Ofor java, spring and eclipse (IDE used to develop);
4. Automatized atualization when importing new dependencies;
5. All Spring Boot libraries will have the same version determined in build.gradle;

#### Application Deployment

1. Create executable .jar: make a distributable binary file that can be easily run with java -jar;
2. From Eclipse: Windows -> Show View -> Other .... Select 'Gradle Task'. Go to build and than select 'bootJar'
3. The executable jar will be in <path>/build/libs
4. Spring Boot Configurations for deployment: application.properties or application.yml (depends on your preference for readability). By default, runs a Apache Tomcat server   on port 8080. We can change the port in application.yml with server.port:8001, per example; See more: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-application-properties.html

#### Spring Data Elasticsearch

1. Spring provides automatic handler for pagination;
2. Add 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch' on build.gradle; Refresh Gradle Project;
3. The class created as "ElasticsearchConfiguration" needs to have a @Configuration annotation from Spring Boot Framework; The class needs to extend "AbstractElasticSearchConfiguration";
4. The most basic configuration is Elasticsearch Host and Port;
5. By default, Elasticsearch will map java date as Elasticsearch long millisecond;
6. Using @Field, @Repository annotations for Elasticseach SDK in Java;
7. ElasticsearchRepository should be extended by a class;
8. In our example, CarElasticRepository.java will do the saving into Elasticsearch;
9. Spring Data Elasticsearch will generate and execute proper API call to Elasticsearch;
10. Spring Data interfaces have basic operations like save, delete, update, find all data etc. without the need to write statements and bind to variables;
11. @Document annotation should be in the POJO that will be stored in Elasticsearch -> @Document(indexName = "<index-in-ES>")

Code block to generate connection with Elasticsearch.

~~~java

@Configuration
public class ElasticSearchConfig extends AbstractElasticsearchConfiguration {

	@Override
	public RestHighLevelClient elasticsearchClient() {
		final var clientConfiguration = ClientConfiguration.builder().connectedTo("localhost:9200").build();
		return RestClients.create(clientConfiguration).rest();
	}	

}

~~~

Interface to perform CRUD operations in Elasticsearch.

~~~java

@Repository
public interface CarElasticRepository extends ElasticsearchRepository<<POJO>, <Type of the identifier of the document, usually String>> {	
	

}

We put up 03 nodes of Elasticsearch. Remember they are running in this URLs:

Elasticsearch 7.6.2 Node 01: http://localhost:9200

Elasticsearch 7.6.2 Node 02: http://localhost:9201

Elasticsearch 7.6.2 Node 03: http://localhost:9203

Kibana 7.6.2: http://localhost:5601

In [Kibana Console Tool](http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/dev_tools/console), you can check the allocation of documents in primary and replica shards using this HTTP requests.

~~~http

GET /_cluster/health

GET /_cat/shards?v

GET /_cat/allocation?v

GET /_cat/nodes?v

GET /_cat/indices?v
